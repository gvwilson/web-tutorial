# Using a Database

## Direct SQL

-   Use [SQLite][sqlite] database in `./data/lab.db` instead of CSV file
-   Install `_dict_factory` [factory function](g:factory-function)
    to get results as list of dictionaries instead of list of tuples
-   And use a flag to convert types like dates and times (used later)
-   [`models_sql.py`](./models_sql.py) implements model part of model-view-controller (MVC)
    -   One function for each question we might ask of our data
    -   Use SQL directly instead of an [object-relational mapper](g:orm)
        like [SQLAlchemy][SQLAlchemy], [SQLModel][sqlmodel], or [Pony][pony]
    -   ORMs can be hard to debug and don't perfectly insulate programs from changes to [schema](g:db-schema)
-   Re-create connection each time model is accessed
    -   Creating it once and attaching to the [Flask][flask] app fails because of [multithreading](g:multithreading)
-   Catch SQLite exceptions and raise our own so that our server only has to catch one thing
-   Add some more error handling

## Query Builder

-   Security problem: we're inserting a user-defined name into a query
    -   Can't parameterize query on column name
    -   Opens us up to SQL injection attack
-   And embedded SQL isn't actually that easy to read
-   Use the [PyPika][pypika] [query builder](g:query-builder)
-   [`pika_demo.py`](./pika_demo.py) is a proof of concept
-   [`models_pika.py`](./models_pika.py) is shorter and more readable than the SQL version
