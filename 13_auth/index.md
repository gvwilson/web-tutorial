    -   Generated by [`make_accounts.py`](./make_accounts.py)
-   Encrypted versions in [`encrypted.csv`](./encrypted.csv)
    -   Encryption and decryption in [`util.py`](./util.py)
    -   Key generation in [`make_key.py`](./make_key.py)
    -   Password encryption in [`encrypt_accounts.py`](./encrypt_accounts.py)
-   [`server.py`](./server.py)
