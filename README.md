This tutorial is a short introduction to web programming using modern tools and practices
for data scientists who are comfortable using Python
but have never built interactive websites before.

## Learner Persona

-   Sabina, 28, has a master's degree in animal physiology
    and now works for a mid-sized veterinary pharmaceutical company.
-   She learned a bit of R in an undergraduate biostatistics course,
    then picked up Python in grad school.
    She spends several hours a week analyzing data with [Pandas][pandas]
    and visualizing it with [Plotly Express][plotly-express],
    and is comfortable with basic Git commands.
-   Sabina recently became responsible for maintaining a dashboard application built with [Dash][dash].
    She believes a better understanding of how web applications work in general
    will help her debug and extend it.
-   Sabina has tried doing asynchronous online courses a couple of times,
    but strongly prefers learning in real time with other people.
