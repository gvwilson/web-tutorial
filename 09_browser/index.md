# JavaScript in the Browser

-   JavaScript was created to make web pages interactive
    -   Load into page (several ways)
    -   Trigger execution (also several ways)
    -   Manipulate [Document Object Model](#g:com) (DOM)
-   [`log_on_load.html`](./log_on_load.html)
    -   Put code directly in `<script>` tag in head of page
    -   Executed as the page loads
    -   View output in console tab in browser's developer tools
    -   But this is not reliable
        -   Code may run while browser is still converting HTML to DOM (or loading other assets)
-   [`log_defer.html`](./log_defer.html) adds `defer` attribute
    -   Wait until page is fully loaded before running code
-   [`show_headings.html`](./show_headings.html) finds things in the DOM
    -   `document` refers to the content of the page
    -   `getElementsByTagName` finds nodes match a [CSS selector](#g:css-selector)
-   But it doesn't show anything
    -   Code may run etc.
-   [`show_headings_onload.html`](./show_headings_onload.html) is a better approach
    -   Define a function
    -   Use the `onload` attribute of `body` to run it when the body has fully loaded
