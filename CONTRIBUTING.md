## Structure

-   Use [mccole][mccole] to turn Markdown into HTML
    -   Markdown files are in root directory and sub-directories
    -   Generated HTML is put in `./docs`
-   `BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` has bibliography as definition list
    -   Citation keys have IDs for linking
    -   Use `[key](b:key)` in files to create links (note the `b:` prefix)
-   `GLOSSARY.md` has glossary as definition list
    -   Reference keys have IDs for linking
    -   Use `[key](g:key)` in files to create links (note the `g:` prefix)
-   Lessons are in `nn_slug` directories
    -   `nn` is two-digit sequence number
    -   `slug` is short mnemonic
-   Each lesson must have:
    -   `index.md`: lesson content
    -   `slides.md`: same content as slides
    -   `Makefile`: re-run tasks
        -   Should `include ../common.mk` to get common tasks
    -   Symbolic links `data` and `static` to the `./data` and `./static` directories in the project root

| commands  | show available commands (default)        |
| datasets  | re-create snailz parameters and datasets |
| lint      | check code and project                   |
| render    | convert to HTML                          |
